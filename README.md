# E_Commerce_Data_Analysis
E_Commerce_Data_Analysis is a Python-based project that analyzes and visualizes trends in a simulated e-commerce dataset of 10,000 records. I built a custom data generator to create realistic transaction data, used pandas for data analysis, and visualized key insights like sales trends, product popularity, and regional performance with Matplotlib.
